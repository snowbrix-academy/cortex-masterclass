## 1. WEEKLY CONTENT CADENCE

### The "3-5-7" Rhythm

Every single week, without exception, Snowbrix publishes:

| Content Type | Quantity | Platform | Time Investment |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Long-Form YouTube Video | **2/week** | YouTube | 8-12 hrs total |
| YouTube Shorts | **5/week** | YouTube + IG Reels + TikTok | 3-4 hrs total |
| LinkedIn Text Posts | **7/week** (daily) | LinkedIn | 3-4 hrs total |
| Twitter/X Threads | **3/week** | Twitter/X | 2 hrs total |
| Community Engagement | **Daily** | Slack + YouTube Comments | 1-2 hrs total |
| Newsletter | **1/week** | Email | 1-2 hrs total |

**Total Weekly Time Investment: ~20-24 hrs of content work**

### Why 2 Long-Form Videos Per Week

One video per week is the "safe" advice. It's also slow-growth advice. Here's the math:

```
1 video/week = 52 videos/year = ~18 months to 10K subscribers (niche technical)
2 videos/week = 104 videos/year = ~9 months to 10K subscribers (niche technical)
3 videos/week = burnout for most teams
```

Two videos is the sweet spot: fast enough to feed the algorithm, sustainable enough to maintain quality. The key is the **content type split**:

### Weekly Video Schedule

```
TUESDAY (Upload by 8 AM EST)                 FRIDAY (Upload by 8 AM EST)
─────────────────────────────                 ─────────────────────────────
"The Workhorse"                               "The Swinger"
─────────────────────────────                 ─────────────────────────────
Format: Autopsy OR Tutorial                   Format: War Room OR Forecast
Length: 8-12 minutes                          Length: 6-20 minutes
Goal: SEO + Evergreen traffic                 Goal: Shareability + Subscribers
Audience: Practitioners                       Audience: Decision Makers + Community
Example: "The $40K Query"                     Example: "AI Won't Replace DEs"
─────────────────────────────                 ─────────────────────────────
Thumbnail: Problem/Solution split             Thumbnail: Bold text + face
Title: Specific + numbers                     Title: Opinionated + broad
```

**Why this split works:**
- **Tuesday = Search traffic.** People google data engineering problems during the workweek. The Autopsy/Tutorial format targets high-intent search queries.
- **Friday = Browse traffic.** People scroll YouTube on Friday afternoons. The War Room/Forecast format targets curiosity and emotional engagement.

## 2. PLATFORM-BY-PLATFORM STRATEGY

### YouTube (PRIMARY — 60% of effort)

**Role in ecosystem:** The trust engine. Long-form content builds deep credibility. YouTube is where strangers become followers, and followers become customers.

**Optimization levers:**

| Lever | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| **Titles** | Lead with numbers or consequences. "The $40K Query" > "Snowflake Cost Optimization." Always A/B test with TubeBuddy or vidIQ. |
| **Thumbnails** | Split Verdict format (from Brand Bible). Test 3 thumbnails per video. Replace underperforming thumbnails after 48 hours. |
| **Descriptions** | First 2 lines = hook + CTA link. Then: full chapter timestamps, 3-5 keyword-rich paragraphs, all links. |
| **Tags** | 15-20 tags per video. Mix broad ("data engineering") and long-tail ("snowflake warehouse sizing best practices"). |
| **Chapters** | Every video gets manual timestamps. YouTube promotes chaptered videos in search. |
| **End Screens** | Always: 1 video suggestion (same pillar) + 1 subscribe button. |
| **Cards** | At least 2 per video: one linking to relevant Autopsy, one to playlist. |
| **Playlists** | Organize by pillar AND by series. Every video in at least 2 playlists. |
| **Community Tab** | 3x/week: polls, behind-the-scenes images, opinion questions. Use polls to research future video topics. |

**YouTube SEO Priority Topics** (based on search volume + low competition):

```
HIGH SEARCH, LOW COMPETITION (Film these first):
├── snowflake warehouse sizing guide
├── databricks cluster configuration best practices
├── snowflake cost optimization
├── dbt snowflake tutorial
├── snowflake vs databricks cost comparison
├── databricks unity catalog setup
├── snowflake query performance tuning
├── migrate from redshift to snowflake
├── databricks delta lake tutorial
└── snowflake rbac best practices

MEDIUM SEARCH, MEDIUM COMPETITION (Film months 2-3):
├── modern data stack architecture
├── data lakehouse vs data warehouse
├── snowflake zero copy clone
├── databricks serverless sql
├── snowflake data sharing
├── data engineering career path
├── apache iceberg tutorial
└── snowflake streams and tasks
```

---

### LinkedIn (SECONDARY — 25% of effort)

**Role in ecosystem:** The conversion engine for B2B consulting leads. LinkedIn is where Decision Makers (CTOs, VPs) live. Every post should make a senior leader think: "This person understands my problems."

**Post Format Rotation (7 days/week):**

| Day | Format | Example |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **Monday** | Unpopular Opinion | "dbt is the most overused tool in the modern data stack. Here's why..." (3-5 paragraphs) |
| **Tuesday** | Video Drop + Insight | "We just published our analysis of a $40K/month Snowflake query. The root cause? [insight]. Full breakdown: [link]" |
| **Wednesday** | Data Point / Stat | "We audited 47 Snowflake accounts last year. The average company wastes 38% of their compute budget. Here's the #1 reason..." |
| **Thursday** | Team Story / BTS | "Our team hit a wall at 2 AM during a migration last week. Here's what happened and what we learned..." |
| **Friday** | Video Drop + Debate | "New video: [title]. My take: [bold claim]. Agree or disagree?" |
| **Saturday** | Career / Industry Take | "The data engineer role is splitting in two. Which side are you on?" |
| **Sunday** | Personal / Reflective | "3 years ago I was a solo consultant. Now we're a team of 7. Here's what I wish I knew..." |

**LinkedIn Posting Rules:**

1. **No external links in the main post body.** LinkedIn throttles posts with links. Put the link in the FIRST COMMENT, and say "Link in comments" in the post.
2. **First line = the hook.** LinkedIn shows ~2 lines before "...see more." Make those 2 lines irresistible.
3. **Use line breaks aggressively.** Short paragraphs. One idea per line. White space is your friend on LinkedIn.
4. **Tag 2-3 relevant people per post** (not spam-tagging — genuine references). "I agree with what @person said about X, but here's where it breaks down..."
5. **Respond to every comment within 2 hours.** LinkedIn's algorithm rewards comment velocity.
6. **Post between 7:00-8:30 AM EST** for maximum reach with the US data engineering audience.

---

### Twitter/X (TERTIARY — 10% of effort)

**Role in ecosystem:** The debate arena. Twitter is where unpopular opinions get amplified, where data engineers quote-tweet hot takes, and where threads get bookmarked.

**Weekly Twitter Plan:**

| Day | Format |
|-----|--------|
| **Monday** | Single hot take tweet (seeds Tuesday video) |
| **Tuesday** | Thread: 5-8 tweets summarizing the video's core lesson |
| **Friday** | Thread: Video takeaways or "3 things I learned this week" |

**Twitter-Specific Tactics:**

- **Quote-tweet industry news** with a Snowbrix perspective. When Snowflake announces a feature, be the first to say: "Here's what this actually means for your bill."
- **Reply to big accounts** (data influencers, Snowflake/Databricks official accounts) with genuinely useful takes. Not self-promotion — real insight.
- **Pin your best-performing thread** and update it monthly.
- **Use 1-2 relevant hashtags max:** #DataEngineering #Snowflake #Databricks. Never more.

---

### Email Newsletter (SUPPORT — 5% of effort)

**Role in ecosystem:** The owned audience. YouTube can change the algorithm. LinkedIn can throttle your reach. Your email list is yours.

**Name:** _"The Migration Log"_

**Cadence:** Weekly, every Thursday at 10 AM EST

**Format (5-minute read):**

```
THE MIGRATION LOG — Issue #[XX]
================================

THIS WEEK'S AUTOPSY (100 words)
Summary of Tuesday's video with link.
"The one thing to remember: [key takeaway]."

THE FORECAST (100 words)
Summary of Friday's video or a standalone industry take.
"What this means for your stack: [implication]."

FROM THE WAR ROOM (50 words)
A single behind-the-scenes insight from the team's week.
"This week we discovered that [X] breaks when [Y]."

ONE THING TO TRY THIS WEEK (50 words)
Actionable tip the reader can implement immediately.
"Run this query on your Snowflake account: [SQL]. If the result is > X, you're overspending."

COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT (50 words)
Highlight a Slack member's question or contribution.

[CTA: Join the Slack | Book a call | Enroll in Academy]
```

**List Building Strategy:**

| Source | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| YouTube | "Free Snowflake Cost Audit Checklist — link in description" (lead magnet) |
| LinkedIn | "I write a weekly newsletter breaking down real migration stories. Link in comments." |
| Slack Community | Automatic opt-in prompt on join (GDPR-compliant, opt-out available) |
| Website | Pop-up with lead magnet on snowbrixacademy.com |

## 3. GROWTH PHASES & MILESTONES

### Phase 1: "The Foundation" (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Establish format, build initial library, prove consistency.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| YouTube Subscribers | 0 → 2,500 |
| YouTube Videos Published | 24 long-form + 60 shorts |
| Avg. Views per Video (long-form) | 500-2,000 |
| LinkedIn Followers | +1,500 |
| Email List | 0 → 500 |
| Slack Community | 0 → 300 members |
| Consulting Leads | 3-5 scoping calls |

**Key Actions:**
- Publish relentlessly. 2 videos/week, no exceptions.
- Optimize titles/thumbnails based on CTR data (target: >5% CTR).
- Comment on every other relevant YouTube video in the niche (genuine, value-adding comments — not spam).
- Personally invite 50 data engineers to the Slack community.
- Guest on 2-3 data engineering podcasts (see Section 9).

**Content Mix:**

```
Month 1:  70% Autopsy / 30% Forecast
          (Establish authority with problems people recognize)

Month 2:  50% Autopsy / 25% War Room / 25% Forecast
          (Introduce the team and multi-format approach)

Month 3:  40% Autopsy / 30% War Room / 20% Forecast / 10% Tutorial
          (Full pillar rotation activated)
```

**What "Success" Looks Like at Month 3:**
- At least 1 video has crossed 10,000 views.
- The comment section is active — people asking follow-up questions, not just "great video."
- You've received at least 1 inbound DM from a potential consulting client who found you through a video.

---

### Phase 2: "The Momentum" (Months 4-6)

**Goal:** Algorithm recognition, community traction, first revenue from content.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| YouTube Subscribers | 2,500 → 10,000 |
| Avg. Views per Video (long-form) | 2,000-8,000 |
| Watch Time (monthly) | 15,000+ hours |
| LinkedIn Followers | 3,000+ |
| Email List | 500 → 2,000 |
| Slack Community | 300 → 1,000 members |
| Consulting Leads | 8-12 scoping calls/month |
| Academy Waitlist | 200+ signups |

**Key Actions:**
- Analyze top 5 performing videos. Double down on what works.
- Launch "Architecture Review: Roast My Diagram" community series.
- Start A/B testing thumbnails systematically (test within first 48 hours).
- Introduce 1 collaboration video per month (see Section 9).
- Announce Academy waitlist. Mention in every CTA rotation.
- Apply for YouTube Partner Program (requires 1K subs + 4K watch hours — should hit by Month 4).

**Content Mix Shift:**

```
Month 4-6:  35% Autopsy / 25% War Room / 20% Forecast / 15% Tutorial / 5% Community
```

**New Format Unlocked: "The Live Stream"**

Starting Month 5, add **1 live stream per month** (60-90 min):

| Live Format | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Office Hours" | Live Q&A. Viewers submit Snowflake/Databricks questions. Answer on screen. |
| "Live Architecture Review" | Viewer submits their architecture diagram. Team reviews it live. |
| "Reaction Stream" | React to new Snowflake/Databricks feature announcements in real-time. |

**Why lives matter:** YouTube heavily promotes live content to subscribers. Lives also generate Shorts clips and build parasocial connection faster than edited videos.

---

### Phase 3: "The Authority" (Months 7-12)

**Goal:** Become the default channel for Snowflake + Databricks content. Launch monetized offerings.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| YouTube Subscribers | 10,000 → 35,000 |
| Avg. Views per Video (long-form) | 5,000-25,000 |
| Watch Time (monthly) | 50,000+ hours |
| LinkedIn Followers | 8,000+ |
| Email List | 2,000 → 8,000 |
| Slack Community | 1,000 → 3,000 members |
| Academy Cohort 1 | 30-50 enrolled students |
| Monthly Consulting Pipeline | $100K-$300K in qualified leads |

**Key Actions:**
- Launch Snowbrix Academy Cohort 1 (8-week program).
- Publish "Year 1 Transparency Report" video (revenue, metrics, lessons — this will go viral in the tech YouTube space).
- Hire a dedicated video editor (if not already done) to increase production quality and reduce your editing time.
- Start approaching Snowflake/Databricks for official partnerships (speaker slots, co-marketing).
- Consider sponsorship deals from complementary tools (dbt, Fivetran, Airbyte, Monte Carlo, etc.).

**Content Mix Shift:**

```
Month 7-12:  30% Autopsy / 25% War Room / 20% Tutorial / 15% Forecast / 10% Community
```

**New Format Unlocked: "The Masterclass" (Monthly)**

One premium-length video per month (25-40 minutes). Deep-dive into a complete topic:
- "The Complete Guide to Snowflake Cost Optimization" (30 min)
- "Building a Production Databricks Lakehouse: Start to Finish" (40 min)
- "The Definitive Snowflake + Databricks Hybrid Architecture" (35 min)

These become the "pillar pages" of your YouTube channel — evergreen, SEO-dominant, high watch-time content that YouTube promotes for years.

---

### Phase 4: "The Platform" (Year 2)

**Goal:** Snowbrix becomes a brand, not a channel. Multiple revenue streams. Industry recognition.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| YouTube Subscribers | 35,000 → 100,000 |
| Academy Students (cumulative) | 200-500 |
| Annual Consulting Revenue | $1M-$3M attributed to content pipeline |
| Speaking Engagements | 4-6/year (Snowflake Summit, Data+AI Summit, etc.) |
| Team Content Creators | 2-3 team members creating their own content under the Snowbrix umbrella |

---

## 4. PRODUCTION WORKFLOW & TEAM ROLES

### Content Production Roles (Within Your Team of 7)

You don't need to hire a separate content team. Distribute content responsibilities across the existing engineering team:

| Role | Person | Weekly Time | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Host / Face** | Founder / Lead Architect | 6-8 hrs | On-camera, scripting, LinkedIn posts, final approval |
| **Content Operator** | 1 team member (rotating monthly) | 4-6 hrs | Shorts editing, thumbnail creation, scheduling, analytics tracking |
| **War Room Contributor** | All 7 team members | 1-2 hrs each | Record standups, screen captures during client work, voice notes for BTS content |
| **Community Manager** | 1 team member (dedicated) | 3-4 hrs | Slack moderation, YouTube comment responses, newsletter assembly |

### Video Production Pipeline

```

```

### Batch Production Strategy

**Film in batches. Edit in batches. Publish on schedule.**

| Batch Window | Content Produced | Covers |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1st Saturday of month (4 hrs) | Film 4 Autopsy/Tutorial videos | 2 weeks of Tuesday videos |
| 2nd Saturday of month (4 hrs) | Film 2 War Room + 2 Forecast videos | 2 weeks of Friday videos |
| 3rd Saturday of month (3 hrs) | Edit all 8 videos + cut shorts | Full month of content |
| Ongoing (daily, 15 min) | Capture screen recordings during real work | War Room source material |

**The "Always Recording" Rule:** Every team member should screen-record interesting moments during client work (with client permission / sanitized). These raw captures become the source material for War Room videos. No separate "content filming" needed — the work IS the content.

---

## 5. YOUTUBE ALGORITHM PLAYBOOK

### The 4 Metrics That Matter (In Order)

```
1. CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR)
   Target: >6% (niche technical channels average 4-5%)
   Controlled by: Thumbnail + Title

2. AVERAGE VIEW DURATION (AVD)
   Target: >50% of video length
   Controlled by: Hook quality + pacing + content value

3. AVERAGE PERCENTAGE VIEWED (APV)
   Target: >40%
   Controlled by: Video length matching content depth (don't pad)

4. SESSION TIME
   Target: Viewer watches another video after yours
   Controlled by: End screens + playlist strategy + "watch next" mentions
```

### Title Formula Matrix

| Formula | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **[Cost/Number] + [Object] + [Consequence]** | "The $40K/Month Snowflake Query Nobody Caught" | Autopsy videos |
| **"Why [Thing Everyone Uses] Is [Negative]"** | "Why Your dbt Models Are Secretly Bankrupting You" | Controversy / opinion |
| **"[Authority Statement] + [Promise]"** | "We Migrated 400 Pipelines in 90 Days. Here's the Playbook." | War Room / credibility |
| **"[Bold Prediction] + [Timeframe]"** | "Every Company Will Run Both Snowflake AND Databricks by 2028" | Forecast |
| **"The [Superlative] [Topic] [Qualifier]"** | "The One Databricks Setting Every New User Gets Wrong" | Tutorial / discovery |
| **"Stop [Common Action]. [Alternative]."** | "Stop Using Snowflake Tasks. Here's Why." | Contrarian how-to |

### Retention Engineering (Minute-by-Minute)

```
0:00 - 0:03  THE SHOCK
             Show a consequence. A number. A broken thing.
             "This single query costs $1,400 every time it runs."
             GOAL: Stop the scroll.

0:03 - 0:30  THE PROMISE
             Tell them what they'll know by the end.
             "By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to find
              queries like this in your own account — and kill them."
             GOAL: Earn the next 60 seconds.

0:30 - 2:00  THE CONTEXT
             Just enough background to understand the problem.
             Not a history lesson. Not "first, let me explain what Snowflake is."
             GOAL: Prevent "I already know this" drop-off.

2:00 - 6:00  THE MEAT
             The actual tutorial/analysis/walkthrough.
             Use pattern interrupts every 90 seconds:
             - Zoom into code
             - Switch to architecture diagram
             - Show a metric/dashboard
             - Change camera angle or screen layout
             GOAL: Maintain attention through the technical middle.

6:00 - 8:00  THE PAYOFF
             Show the result. Before/after. Cost savings. Working pipeline.
             "Here's the same query running on a Medium warehouse.
              $1,400 became $12. Same result set."
             GOAL: Deliver the dopamine hit that makes them trust you.

8:00 - END   THE BRIDGE
             Extract the principle. Deliver the soft CTA.
             GOAL: Convert attention into action (subscribe, click, join).
```

### Pattern Interrupts (Use Every 60-90 Seconds)

| Interrupt Type | Description | Effect |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Zoom Cut** | Zoom into a specific line of code or config | Re-focuses attention |
| **Diagram Switch** | Cut from code to architecture diagram | Shifts cognitive mode |
| **Counter/Timer** | On-screen number counting up (cost) or down (time) | Creates urgency |
| **Split Screen** | Before vs. After side by side | Visual comparison lock |
| **B-Roll Terminal** | Cut to terminal running a command | "This is real" moment |
| **Text Callout** | Large text overlay with key number/phrase | Emphasizes takeaway |
| **Voice Tone Shift** | Drop to near-whisper for the key insight | Creates intimacy |

---

## 6. SHORTS STRATEGY

### The 5-Shorts-Per-Week System

| Short # | Day | Source | Format |
|---------|-----|--------|--------|
| **Short 1** | Monday | Last Tuesday's long-form | "The One Thing" — single insight, 30 sec |
| **Short 2** | Tuesday | Today's long-form (teaser) | "Wait For It" — builds to a surprising result |
| **Short 3** | Wednesday | Original (not from a video) | "Myth vs. Reality" — debunks a common belief |
| **Short 4** | Thursday | Last Friday's long-form | "The Cost Of" — starts with a dollar amount |
| **Short 5** | Friday | Today's long-form (teaser) | "In 60 Seconds" — compressed tutorial |

### Shorts Format Templates

#### Template 1: "The One Thing" (30 seconds)

```
[SCREEN: Code or dashboard]
[VOICE]: "If you remember ONE thing about Snowflake warehouse sizing..."
[PAUSE — 1 sec]
[VOICE]: "It's this."
[SHOW: The key config/query/setting]
[VOICE]: Quick 15-second explanation
[TEXT ON SCREEN]: The rule, summarized in <10 words
[VOICE]: "Full breakdown on the channel."
```

#### Template 2: "Wait For It" (45 seconds)

```
[SCREEN: Query running or cost dashboard loading]
[VOICE]: "Watch what happens when I run this query on an XL warehouse..."
[SCREEN: Result loads — $1,400]
[VOICE]: "Now watch the same query on a Medium..."
[SCREEN: Result loads — $12]
[VOICE]: "Same data. Same result. 99% less cost."
[TEXT]: "Link to full video in comments"
```

#### Template 3: "Myth vs. Reality" (40 seconds)

```
[SPLIT SCREEN or TEXT SWAP]
LEFT: "MYTH: Bigger warehouses = faster queries"
RIGHT: "REALITY: Query complexity determines optimal size"
[VOICE]: Explains why in 20 seconds
[SCREEN]: Shows the proof (benchmark, metric, screenshot)
[VOICE]: "Stop overpaying."
```

#### Template 4: "The Cost Of" (30 seconds)

```
[LARGE TEXT]: "$347"
[VOICE]: "That's what this single dbt model costs to run. Every. Single. Day."
[SCREEN]: Shows the model + warehouse config
[VOICE]: "Here's the fix..." (10-second explanation)
[TEXT]: "Full autopsy on the channel."
```

#### Template 5: "In 60 Seconds" (60 seconds)

```
[VOICE]: "How to check if your Snowflake account is bleeding money — in 60 seconds."
[TIMER on screen: counting down from 60]
[VOICE]: Step 1... Step 2... Step 3...
[SCREEN]: Shows each step being executed
[VOICE]: "If your number is above [X], you have a problem."
[TEXT]: "Free audit checklist — link in bio"
```

### Shorts-to-Long-Form Funnel

```
VIEWER SEES SHORT (Discover)
       ↓
VIEWER CHECKS CHANNEL (Evaluate)
       ↓
VIEWER WATCHES 1 LONG-FORM (Trust)
       ↓
VIEWER SUBSCRIBES (Commit)
       ↓
ALGORITHM SHOWS MORE (Loop)
```

**Critical Rule:** Every Short must end with a reason to visit the main channel. Not "subscribe" — a *reason*: "Full breakdown on the channel" / "The fix took us 3 hours — full story on the channel" / "Free checklist in the full video."

### Shorts Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Month 1-3 | Month 4-6 | Month 7-12 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Avg. Views per Short | 500-2K | 2K-10K | 10K-50K |
| Shorts → Channel Visit Rate | 2-4% | 4-6% | 6-10% |
| Shorts → Subscribe Rate | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 2-3% |

## 7. LINKEDIN DOMINATION PLAN

### Why LinkedIn Is the Secret Weapon

YouTube builds the audience. **LinkedIn closes the deals.**

The Decision Maker segment (CTOs, VPs of Data, Founders) lives on LinkedIn. They don't binge YouTube tutorials. But they DO read LinkedIn posts at 7 AM with their coffee. One viral LinkedIn post to the right audience is worth more than 100,000 YouTube views from junior engineers.

### The LinkedIn Content System

#### Post Type 1: "The Contrarian Take" (Mondays)

```
FORMULA:
Line 1: Bold, disagreeable statement (this is all they see before "...see more")
Line 2: Empty line
Line 3-5: The evidence (short paragraphs, 1-2 sentences each)
Line 6: Empty line
Line 7: The implication for the reader
Line 8: Empty line
Line 9: Question to drive comments

EXAMPLE:
"Most companies should NOT migrate to Snowflake.

I know. That's a weird thing for a Snowflake consultant to say.

But after auditing 47 environments last year, here's what I found:

→ 60% of migrations were driven by 'everyone else is doing it'
→ 30% had no cost model before they started
→ 15% would have been better off optimizing their existing warehouse

The cloud migration industry has a dirty secret:
Sometimes the ROI is negative. And nobody gets fired for choosing Snowflake.

Before you migrate, answer this:
What specific problem does this solve that optimization cannot?

If you can't answer in one sentence, you're not ready.

What's the worst migration decision you've seen? ↓"
```

#### Post Type 2: "The Number" (Wednesdays)

```
FORMULA:
Line 1: A single, striking number
Line 2: What it represents
Lines 3-6: The story behind it
Lines 7-8: The actionable lesson

EXAMPLE:
"$247,000.

That's how much one client was overspending on Snowflake credits. Per year.

Not because Snowflake is expensive.
Because nobody was watching.

→ 14 warehouses running 24/7 (only 3 needed to be)
→ XL warehouses for queries that ran on Small
→ Zero auto-suspend policies
→ No resource monitors with alerts

We fixed it in 2 weeks. The annual savings paid for our entire engagement 4x over.

The lesson isn't about Snowflake. It's about governance.

If you haven't audited your cloud data spend in the last 90 days,
you're probably leaving six figures on the table.

```

#### Post Type 3: "The Team Story" (Thursdays)

```
FORMULA:
Line 1: Situation that creates tension
Lines 2-5: What happened
Lines 6-8: How the team responded
Lines 9-10: The lesson + human element

EXAMPLE:
"At 2:14 AM last Thursday, our monitoring fired.

A production pipeline for a client processing 2TB daily had silently failed.
No errors. No alerts. Just... missing data.

Here's how our team of 7 responded:

→ 2:14 AM: Alert fires. On-call engineer (Raj) starts triage.
→ 2:30 AM: Root cause identified — a schema change upstream broke a Delta merge.
→ 2:45 AM: Raj pulls in Maria for a second pair of eyes.
→ 3:15 AM: Fix deployed. Backfill running.
→ 5:00 AM: All data reconciled. Client never noticed.

Nobody teaches you this part of data engineering.

The migrations, the architecture diagrams, the tool comparisons — that's the easy part.

The hard part is building a team that wakes up at 2 AM
and calmly fixes what's broken before the client's morning standup.

That's what we do. That's what we teach."
```

### LinkedIn Growth Tactics

| Tactic | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Comment Strategy** | Spend 15 min/day commenting on posts from: data engineering influencers, Snowflake/Databricks employees, CTOs sharing data challenges. Add genuine insight, not "Great post!" |
| **Tag Strategy** | Tag 2-3 people per post who would genuinely find it valuable. Not influencer-baiting — real relevance. |
| **Hashtag Strategy** | Use 3-5 per post: #DataEngineering #Snowflake #Databricks #CloudMigration #DataArchitecture |
| **Connection Requests** | Send 10-15 targeted connection requests per week to: VP/Dir of Data, CTOs at mid-market companies, Data Platform leads. Include a personalized note referencing their company or a shared interest. |
| **LinkedIn Newsletter** | Launch at 1,000+ followers. Repurpose "The Migration Log" email content. LinkedIn promotes newsletters to connections. |

---

## 8. COMMUNITY GROWTH ENGINE

### The Slack Community: "The Snowbrix Engineering Room"

**This is the most underrated growth lever in the entire strategy.** A well-run Slack community does three things no other platform can:

1. **Generates content ideas** (members ask real questions = future video topics)
2. **Creates social proof** (2,000 engineers in your community = credibility)
3. **Shortens the sales cycle** (prospects lurk, see value, then book a call)

### Community Growth Milestones

| Phase | Size | Key Features |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Seed** (Month 1-2) | 0-300 | Manual invitations. Personal DMs. Founder active daily. |
| **Grow** (Month 3-6) | 300-1,000 | Organic join from YouTube/LinkedIn. Weekly events. |
| **Scale** (Month 7-12) | 1,000-3,000 | Self-sustaining discussions. Member-led threads. |
| **Monetize** (Year 2) | 3,000-10,000 | Premium tier ($29/mo) with exclusive content + office hours. |

### Slack Channel Structure

```
#general              — Introductions and general discussion
#snowflake-help       — Snowflake troubleshooting (team monitors daily)
#databricks-help      — Databricks troubleshooting (team monitors daily)
#architecture-review  — Post your diagram, get feedback
#job-board            — Data engineering roles (members post, no recruiters)
#war-stories          — Share your production incidents (anonymized)
#content-ideas        — Vote on what Snowbrix should cover next
#wins                 — Celebrate shipped features, passed certs, new jobs
#announcements        — Snowbrix videos, events, academy updates (low-traffic)
```

### Weekly Community Events

| Day | Event | Duration | Format |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| **Tuesday** | "Video Discussion Thread" | Async (24h) | Post-video discussion with bonus insights not in the video |
| **Thursday** | "Office Hours" | 60 min live | AMA-style. Team answers questions in real-time on a voice channel |
| **Friday** | "Architecture Roast" | Async (48h) | Member submits an architecture diagram. Community + team review |

### Community-to-Revenue Conversion Paths

```
Path 1: Community → Academy
Member asks questions → Realizes knowledge gap → Sees Academy mentioned → Enrolls

Path 2: Community → Consulting
CTO lurks in community → Sees team's expertise in answers → Books scoping call

Path 3: Community → Content → Referral
Member shares Snowbrix content internally → Their company hires Snowbrix

Path 4: Community → Job Board → Goodwill
Member finds a job through the community → Becomes lifetime advocate
```

## 9. COLLABORATION & CROSS-PROMOTION

### Collaboration Tiers

#### Tier 1: Guest Appearances (Month 1-6)

**Be a guest, not a host.** Early on, you gain more by appearing on established channels than by inviting small creators to yours.

**Target Podcasts/Channels:**

| Show/Channel | Audience | Pitch Angle |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Data Engineering Podcast | Data engineers, 50K+ listeners | "Real-world migration war stories" |
| Seattle Data Guy (YouTube) | 100K+ subs, data eng | "The hybrid Snowflake + Databricks architecture nobody's building" |
| Analytics Engineering Podcast | dbt community | "Why dbt is overused (friendly debate)" |
| Conf42 / Data Council talks | Conference audiences | "Lessons from 12 production migrations" |
| ThoughtSpot / Atlan webinars | Data leaders | "Cost optimization: What vendors don't tell you" |

**Pitch Template:**

> Subject: Collaboration idea — real migration war stories
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> I run a data engineering consulting team (Snowbrix, team of 7) and we're launching a YouTube channel documenting our real client work — migrations, cost audits, architecture builds.
>
> I'd love to come on [Show Name] and share a specific story: [1-sentence hook, e.g., "how we cut a client's Snowflake bill from $50K/mo to $8K/mo in two weeks."]
>
> No pitch. Just war stories and technical specifics your audience can use.
>
> Here's a sample of our content: [link to best-performing video]
>
> Worth a conversation?

#### Tier 2: Co-Created Content (Month 6-12)

Once you have 5K+ subscribers, start **joint videos** with complementary creators:

| Partner Type | Video Concept |
|-------------|--------------|
| dbt creator | "dbt + Snowflake: What the docs don't cover" |
| Airflow/Dagster creator | "Orchestrating Snowflake + Databricks: The ugly truth" |
| Cloud cost optimization creator | "We audited each other's cloud bills — live" |
| Data quality creator | "The migration testing framework nobody uses" |

#### Tier 3: Vendor Partnerships (Month 9+)

| Partner | What You Offer | What You Get |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Snowflake | Honest, technical content that drives adoption | Speaker slots, early access, co-marketing |
| Databricks | Real-world implementation stories | Feature previews, case study support |
| dbt Labs | Content that shows dbt in production (good and bad) | Community amplification |
| Tool vendors (Fivetran, Monte Carlo, etc.) | Authentic reviews with production data | Sponsorship revenue ($2K-$10K/video) |

### Decision Framework: When to Change Strategy

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| CTR <4% consistently | Titles/thumbnails aren't working | Overhaul thumbnail formula. Study top-performing videos in niche. |
| AVD <35% | Content isn't holding attention | Tighten scripts. Cut video length. Add more pattern interrupts. |
| Views high but subs low | Content is interesting but not "must-follow" | Increase series content (War Room multi-parters). Build anticipation for next video. |
| Subs high but views low | Subscribers aren't getting notified / clicking | Adjust upload schedule. Test different days/times. Improve first-24-hour promotion. |
| LinkedIn posts get <500 impressions | Algorithm isn't distributing | Post earlier (7 AM). Increase comment engagement on others' posts. Vary format. |
| Slack community stagnant | Not enough value / activity | Launch a challenge (e.g., "Optimize Your Snowflake Account in 7 Days"). Host more events. |
| Scoping calls booked but not converting | Audience mismatch or pricing | Qualify leads better in CTA language. Target larger companies in content. |
| Shorts views much higher than long-form | Shorts audience ≠ long-form audience | Add stronger bridges from Shorts to full videos. Ensure Short content is niche, not broad. |

### When to Scale Content Production

**Add a 3rd video per week ONLY when:**
- [ ] Average CTR > 6% across last 20 videos
- [ ] Average AVD > 45% across last 20 videos
- [ ] Subscriber growth > 1,000/month consistently
- [ ] You have a dedicated editor (not editing yourself)
- [ ] Content pipeline has 8+ weeks of ideas banked

**Do NOT scale based on:** subscriber count alone, comparisons to other channels, or "gut feeling."

```

### Sponsorship Guidelines

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Only sponsor tools you actually use in client work | Authenticity is the brand. One fake recommendation destroys trust. |
| Maximum 60-second sponsor read, mid-roll only | Longer reads feel like infomercials. Mid-roll = after you've delivered value. |
| Clearly disclose: "This video is sponsored by [X]" | Legal requirement + audience respects transparency. |
| Never let sponsors influence your opinion | If a sponsor asks to remove criticism of their tool, drop them. |
| Charge based on CPM, not flat rate | At $10-15 CPM (niche technical), a 20K-view video = $200-300 in value. Charge 3-5x for the authority premium. |
| Minimum rate: $150 per 1,000 views (expected) | Technical audiences are worth more than general audiences. |

**The gap Snowbrix fills:** Nobody is doing production-focused, team-based, hybrid Snowflake + Databricks content. The niche is specific enough to own, broad enough to grow.

## FINAL PRINCIPLE: THE CONSISTENCY COMPOUND

```
Week 1:    2 videos, 5 shorts, 7 LinkedIn posts = 14 pieces
Month 1:   8 videos, 20 shorts, 28 LinkedIn posts = 56 pieces
Quarter 1: 24 videos, 60 shorts, 84 LinkedIn posts = 168 pieces
Year 1:    104 videos, 260 shorts, 365 LinkedIn posts = 729 pieces

Each piece is a lottery ticket.
Most won't go viral.
Some will.
All compound.

The algorithm rewards consistency.
The audience rewards reliability.
The business rewards patience.

Show up every Tuesday and Friday for 52 weeks.
Everything else takes care of itself.
```
